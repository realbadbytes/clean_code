file.c --> preprocessor
preprocesser handles #include and #define directives, strips out comments
result is "processed C file" that has contents of includes copy-pasted inside
in this example, stdio.h and math.h are inside preprocessor output file 
output --> compiler --> file.s
compiler translates C to asm
file.s -> assembler -> file.o
translate asm to object file
object file is compiled file that is targeted for specific cpu and OS. not an executable yet
file.o --> linker --> executable file
linker brings together object files and creates ELF

clang or gcc has options to invoke just single steps
preprocessor only -E
up through compiler -S
up through assembler -c
