# clean_code
## What
A repository documenting shit code and ways to make it less shit. Writing clean code is important to reduce technical debt (Technical debt (also known as design debt or code debt) is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.)
## Why
I am tired of writing, reading, and/or working on shit code.
## Who
Me and you.
